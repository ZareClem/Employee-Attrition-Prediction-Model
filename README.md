# Understanding Employee Attrition: Patterns, Causes, and Predictive Insights

## Objective:
The primary objective of this project was to construct a predictive model for analyzing employee turnover within a company. The goal was to identify key factors influencing employee churn and forecast which employees are at risk of leaving, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Data Overview:
The dataset encompassed several features, including satisfaction levels, project involvement, average monthly hours, tenure, work accidents, employment status, and recent promotions. These attributes provided a comprehensive view of employee dynamics.

## Methods and Models:
To tackle this business challenge, a range of models were deployed, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Each model underwent rigorous evaluation based on performance metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC Score. This ensured the selection of the most effective model for predicting employee turnover.

## Business Problem:
The HR department at Salifort Motors is seeking to enhance employee satisfaction levels within the company. With data collected from employees, they are confronted with the challenge of leveraging this information effectively. As a data analytics professional, they turn to you for data-driven insights to address their pressing question: what factors are likely to lead an employee to leave the company?

### Project Goals:
Analyze the HR department's dataset to discern patterns and trends related to employee turnover.
Develop a predictive model capable of identifying employees at risk of leaving the company.
Provide actionable recommendations based on insights derived from the data, aiming to mitigate employee turnover and bolster retention efforts.

### Expected Outcome:
By accurately predicting employees who may quit, Salifort Motors can proactively identify underlying factors contributing to attrition. This proactive approach not only saves time and resources associated with recruitment but also fosters a positive work environment conducive to employee satisfaction and retention, ultimately benefiting the company's overall productivity and success.
