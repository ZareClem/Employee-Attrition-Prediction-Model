# Understanding Employee Attrition: Patterns, Causes, and Predictive Insights

## Objective:
The primary objective of this project was to construct a predictive model for analyzing employee turnover within a company. The goal was to identify key factors influencing employee churn and forecast which employees are at risk of leaving, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Data Overview:
The dataset encompassed several features, including satisfaction levels, project involvement, average monthly hours, tenure, work accidents, employment status, and recent promotions. These attributes provided a comprehensive view of employee dynamics.

## Methods and Models:
To tackle this business challenge, a range of models were deployed, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Each model underwent rigorous evaluation based on performance metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC Score. This ensured the selection of the most effective model for predicting employee turnover.
